ComPAN 8 - CRT.pdf - Genuine schematics of CRT module from MERA 79xx series terminal. ComPAN used these modules, so the schematics should be interchangeable.

c262-3-4-navod.pdf - Schematics of Czechoslovak keyboard by Zbrojovka Brno.

All other schematics are based on my reverse engineering of ComPAN boards. They might contain errors since I did them with no access to documentation to verify my results.
